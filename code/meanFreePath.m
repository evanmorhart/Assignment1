function meanFreePath(system,electron, numLoops, timeStep)
%meanFreePath Simulates electrons moving through silicon with collision
%   meanFreePath(system,electron, numLoops, timeStep)
%   Inpus:
%       system     - Structure containing properties of silicon sample
%       electron   - Structure containing properties of electrons
%       numLoops   - Number of loops that the simulation will run for
%       timeStep   - Length of time between each plot update
%   Outputs:
%       None
